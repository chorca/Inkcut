# Inkcut '2.0'

This is a fork of the last-worked-on Inkcut version by Jalrus Martin (https://github.com/frmdstryr/Inkcut)

I'll be using it to try and push forward with some of the designs and desires of the original author,
even though I'm not very good at programming.

Hopefully I can get things working well enough.
